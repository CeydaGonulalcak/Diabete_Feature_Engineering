# Diabete_Feature_Engineering
In this project, data analysis and feature engineering steps will be taken to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes or not. By going through stages such as data collection, cleaning, visualization and feature engineering, the best model will be created and the results will be presented. This study aims to provide valuable information about diabetes by emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis in the field of health.

# Business Problem
Predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified.
It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can model
data analysis and feature engineering steps required before development
you are expected to do.

# Dataset Story
The dataset is part of the large dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. in the USA
On Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona.
Data used for diabetes research.

The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 indicates positive diabetes test result, 0 indicates negative.

# Variables
* Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
* Glucose: Glucose
* BloodPressure: Blood pressure
* SkinThickness: Skin Thickness
* Insulin: Insulin
* BMI: Body mass index
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that calculates our chances of having diabetes based on people in our ancestry
* Age: Age (years)
* Outcome: Information about whether the person has diabetes or not. Having the disease (1) or not (0)
